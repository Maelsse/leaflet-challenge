            The USGS monitors, analyzes, and predicts current and evolving Earth-system interactions and delivers
            actionable information at scales and timeframes relevant to decision makers. The USGS provides science about
            natural hazards, natural resources, ecosystems and environmental health, and the effects of climate and
            land-use change.

            The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake
            data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way
            of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate
            the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our
            planet
          </p>

            This site creates the maps with each visualization results of the collected earthquakes and tectonic plates data.
